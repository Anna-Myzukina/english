Using Git and Github


At Microverse, you will use Git and GitHub to keep track of all the changes to your
code as well as to collaborate with your coding partner.
Getting familiar with Git and GitHub will make it way easier for you to join a 
company and immediately understand their workflow.
Almost every single company that you can join uses Git and GitHub.



If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub yet, please complete the following lessons:

Using GitHub Flow (Feature Branch Flow)

In the previous section, we introduced a lot of new ideas and best practices.
However, this is one that we definitely need you to follow 

Before you continue, please take a look at the links below and make sure you clearly understand what GitHub Flow is. 
You should be using it for every single line of code you write.

SPOILER ALERT Github Flow is slightly different than Git Flow, even if their names look alike. 
If you look for additional information, please make sure that you 
are using the correct name - Github Flow. 



Feature Branches
Before you start working on a new feature, you should create a new “feature” branch. 
You will use this branch for all your work. Every time you switch roles with your 
coding partner (i.e. driver and navigator), just commit and push the changes to the
feature branch and the new driver will fetch the changes in their computer.

In order to get a deeper understanding of feature branches, watch those 
2 videos and try git commands presented in them:

Them, in order to get a deeper understanding of creating GitHub Pull Requests from your branches, 
watch those 2 videos:

Collaborating on Github: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnUd31TvBoU">video</a>

And the last but not least: 
remember that your branch name should be descriptive 
(e.g., refactor-authentication, user-content-cache-key, make-retina-avatars), 
so that others can see what is being worked on.
